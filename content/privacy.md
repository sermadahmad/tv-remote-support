# Universal TV Remote Privacy Policy

Effective date: November 9, 2026

Universal TV Remote is provided by **SERMAD AHMAD**. This policy explains how the
mobile app and its privacy, support, and testing website handle information.
Contact **[fixemj@gmail.com](mailto:fixemj@gmail.com)** with privacy questions or
requests.

## Local TV control

The app discovers and controls compatible Android TV and Google TV devices on
your local network. It receives TV service names, local network addresses,
connection information, supported controls, and feedback such as volume status.
It sends the remote commands you choose directly to your TV. A TV pairing code
is used to establish the connection and is not saved by the app.

Saved TV names, local endpoints, device identity information, the selected TV,
and appearance, haptic, and introduction preferences are stored on your phone.
Android Keystore protects Android pairing keys; iOS Keychain protects iOS
pairing keys. The app does not export private pairing keys to a developer
server. Credential references are stored separately from ordinary preferences.

There is no app account, developer-operated TV-control backend, advertising SDK,
analytics SDK, or remote crash-reporting service configured in the app. TV
control does not require an internet connection, although the phone and TV must
be reachable on the same local network. The app does not request access to your
location, contacts, microphone, photos, or Bluetooth devices.

## Optional Google Play updates on Android

Android distribution builds use Google's Play In-App Updates library to check
for newer app versions when the app opens or returns from the background, and
when you choose **Check for updates**. Google Play needs internet access for
these checks and downloads. You can postpone an available update and separately
choose when to restart for installation. Offline update checks do not prevent
local TV control. This update feature is not used on iOS.

Google's disclosure says its update service handles **device metadata, the
application version, and the list of installed modules and asset packs** to
determine update availability and download size. Google states that this data
is encrypted, is not transferred to third parties, and is deleted after a fixed
retention period; it does not specify that period on the disclosure page.
Google Play runs its own processes under the
[Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/).
See [Google's update SDK data-handling disclosure](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#data-safety).

The app does not send TV names, TV addresses, pairing codes, pairing credentials,
or remote commands to Google as part of its update requests. It has no custom
update backend and does not download app updates from a developer-operated
server.

## Support and testing

If you email us, we receive your email address, your message, and any information
you choose to include. We use this correspondence to answer the inquiry,
investigate problems, and maintain relevant support records. Please do not send
TV pairing codes, passwords, private keys, or unnecessary personal information.
Keep any screenshots or diagnostic details limited to what is needed to explain
the problem.

Joining an optional Google Group or Google Play test uses your Google Account
under Google's terms. Group owners can see membership information that Google
provides, such as your account name and email address. Test participation does
not create an account in Universal TV Remote. Feedback you voluntarily send is
handled as support correspondence.

## Website and external services

Our primary privacy, support, and testing website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
GitHub records visitors’ IP addresses for security, including when visitors are
not signed in. Its privacy statement explains additional request information it
processes, its retention practices, and privacy rights. See
[GitHub Pages’ data-collection disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#data-collection)
and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

Older privacy, support, and testing links at
universal-tv-remote-support.sermadahmad024.chatgpt.site remain available through
Sites hosting and its infrastructure providers. Serving and protecting those
pages involves processing ordinary request information, such as an IP address,
browser information, requested page, and request time.

We do not add analytics, advertising trackers, sign-in, or information-submission
forms to either website. The app does not send saved TVs, pairing codes, pairing
credentials, or remote commands to these websites.

External links open services such as Google Play, Google Groups, or your email
application. Those services handle information under their own policies. Your
phone's operating system and app-distribution service may also handle their own
diagnostics according to your platform settings.

## Retention, deletion, and your choices

Local TV information remains on the phone until you change it, forget the TV, or
remove the app's local data. **Saved → Forget TV** deletes that TV's saved record
and local pairing credentials. It does not revoke authorization stored on the
TV; remove the app's authorization through the TV's settings if needed. Theme,
haptic, and introduction preferences remain until you change or clear them.

On Android, clearing the app's storage or uninstalling removes its app data and
Android Keystore credentials. Android app backup is disabled. On iOS, Keychain
items can remain after uninstalling, so use **Forget TV before uninstalling**
when you want to remove the app's saved TV credentials. The app uses device-only,
non-synchronizing Keychain protection rather than iCloud synchronization for
those credentials.

We retain voluntary support correspondence only as needed to handle the inquiry,
maintain relevant support records, and meet applicable legal obligations. You
can request deletion of correspondence by emailing
[fixemj@gmail.com](mailto:fixemj@gmail.com). We cannot delete local information
on a phone we do not control or data held independently by Google or a hosting
provider. Use those providers' privacy controls for information they maintain.

## Security and policy updates

TV connections use TLS and the pairing trust established with your TV. Local
pairing keys use the phone's native credential protection. No security measure
can guarantee protection in every circumstance; keep your phone and home
network secure.

The app is a general household utility intended for ages 13 and older and is not
designed or marketed specifically to children under 13. We do not sell personal
information or use it for advertising.

If this policy changes, the updated policy will appear on this website’s Privacy
page with a revised effective date.
